            <h3>Sales Intern</h3>
            <h4>WhiteHat Jr.</h4>
            <h5>Work from home</h5>
                <p>I had the opportunity to begin my internship journey at
                    Whitehat Jr as a sales intern. During this time, I was able to
                    effectively pitch to customers, resulting in a noticeable increase
                    in sales. I was among a select few interns who made a significant contribution to the company's profits, for which I was acknowledged
                    and awarded. This experience sparked a strong interest in me for a
                    career in sales.
